/**
 * A coupon must not be created with an expiry that has already passed.
 *
 * Nothing checked the dates against *now*, only expireDate >= startDate. So an admin could
 * save a coupon whose expiry was last week: it validated, appeared in the coupon list, and
 * then failed for every customer who typed it — because both GetAvailableCoupons and the
 * redemption path require startDate <= now <= expireDate. A coupon that cannot be redeemed
 * by anyone is never what the admin meant.
 *
 * The asymmetry between the two dates is the point of this suite, and it is not arbitrary —
 * it falls out of how each is parsed:
 *
 *   parseDate(expireDate, endOfDay = true)  ->  YYYY-MM-DD becomes 23:59:59.999 of that day
 *   parseDate(startDate)                    ->  YYYY-MM-DD becomes 00:00:00.000 of that day
 *
 * So "today" as an expiry is still in the future, while "today" as a start is already in the
 * past. Refusing a past start date would reject the most ordinary entry an admin can make,
 * and backdating a start is legitimate regardless: it means "live immediately".
 *
 * Run with `npm run test:coupon-dates` (or `npm test` for everything).
