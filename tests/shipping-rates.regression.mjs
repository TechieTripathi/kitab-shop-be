/**
 * Live courier shipping rates (Phase D2).
 *
 * Shipping was hardcoded free: `shippingCharge = 0` in order-pricing.service.js. So this
 * feature is not "swap a flat rate for a live one" — it is the difference between charging
 * a customer nothing and charging them something, which is why every property below is
 * about not doing that by accident.
 *
 *   OFF BY DEFAULT, and the default is load-bearing. A deploy must not start charging.
 *
 *   FAILS SOFT — the deliberate opposite of the COD pincode gate. That gate refuses when it
 *   cannot be evaluated, because letting COD through would defeat the restriction. A rate
 *   that cannot be fetched must NOT block checkout: the store already ships free, so
 *   falling back to free is both the safe answer and the existing behaviour. Turning a
 *   courier API blip into a lost sale would be the worse failure.
 *
 *   NEVER SILENTLY CHEAPER. A missing or non-numeric rate is unknown, not zero. Treating it
 *   as zero would quietly hand the customer the best possible answer and eat the cost.
 *
 *   NOT CACHED, ON PURPOSE. A 60s memo on serviceability was tried, to spare the second
 *   call a COD checkout makes once rates are on. It was removed: the COD pincode gate reads
 *   the same endpoint, and caching made that business restriction answer from a stale
 *   snapshot of courier availability. Trading the correctness of a gate for one HTTP request
 *   is the wrong way round, so the duplicate call stands — and only when both are on.
 *
 * Run with `npm run test:shipping-rates` (or `npm test` for everything).
