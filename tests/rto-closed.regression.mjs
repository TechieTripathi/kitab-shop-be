/**
 * The RTO lifecycle terminal state (audit H2-05, Option A: `Closed` only).
 *
 *   RTO ──▶ RTO Received ──▶ Closed
 *
 * An RTO used to close out as "Cancelled", which made that status mean two
 * different things: "called off before dispatch" and "we shipped it and it came
 * back". Both must stay out of revenue, but only one is a cancellation, and the
 * overloading hid the distinction from every report and every operator.
 *
 * `RTO In Transit` is deliberately NOT added: the reporting need it was meant to
 * serve (awaiting receipt vs received) is already answered by RTO vs RTO Received,
 * and its only trigger would be a fragile courier text match with no status id.
 *
 * Run with `npm run test:rto-closed` (or `npm test` for everything).
 *
 * The webhook scenarios drive the REAL ShippingWebhook including its token auth, so
 * the mapper, the transition table, the COD promotion and the RTO refund branch all
 * run as deployed.
