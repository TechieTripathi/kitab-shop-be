/**
 * One OPEN return per order line — the duplicate guard, and the concurrency
 * primitive for creating returns.
 *
 * This replaced an unconditional `{order, product, user}` unique index, which made
 * exactly one return document per line possible FOR ALL TIME. That is stricter
 * than the lifecycle this model implements, and it produced two dead ends:
 *
 *   - `rejected` is terminal and there is no reopen endpoint, so a QC rejection
 *     made in error permanently barred the customer from re-requesting. The only
 *     remedy was editing the database by hand.
 *   - `quantity` is stored and validated per request, so returning 1 of 5 units is
 *     clearly intended — but the first such return exhausted the line and the
 *     other 4 could never be returned, inside the policy window or not.
 *
 * PARTIAL on the open statuses, which is what makes both legitimate cases work
 * while still refusing a genuine duplicate: a second request lands only once the
 * first has resolved, and two concurrent requests both write `pending`, both match
 * the filter, and the loser gets E11000. That E11000 is the real protection — the
 * application's `findOne` check ahead of it is a read-then-act pair that two
 * simultaneous requests can both pass.
 *
 * EXPLICITLY NAMED so it can coexist with the old auto-named index while
 * `npm run migrate:return-open-index` removes that one. An auto-named replacement
 * would collide with `order_1_product_1_user_1` and fail with IndexKeySpecsConflict
 * on every boot, silently leaving the old, over-strict constraint in force.
 *
 * Note this index bounds the NUMBER of concurrent returns, not their quantities.
 * Cumulative quantity is capped in CreateReturnRequest against
 * QUANTITY_CONSUMING_RETURN_STATUSES; that check is safe as a read-then-sum
 * precisely because this index serialises creations.
