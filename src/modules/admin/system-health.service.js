/**
 * Operational health / configuration report for the admin panel.
 *
 * Motivated by the production audit: most of the worst problems found were
 * SILENT MISCONFIGURATIONS, not code bugs — payments live while the Razorpay
 * webhook was disabled (captured payments lost with no reconciler), test keys
 * that take no real money, auth-security off making logout a no-op, and a
 * standalone MongoDB that would make every checkout transaction throw. None of
 * those were visible anywhere in the product.
 *
 * Two rules this file follows:
 *   1. NEVER return a secret. Only booleans, modes, and masked hints.
 *   2. Severity comes from COMBINATIONS, not from individual flags. A flag dump
 *      tells an admin nothing; "payments are live but the webhook is off" does.
