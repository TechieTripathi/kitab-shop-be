/**
 * Closes out prepaid checkouts that were never paid for.
 *
 * Order-first means an unpaid Razorpay order exists from the moment checkout
 * starts. Every read path excludes it (order-visibility.js), but "invisible
 * forever" is not the same as resolved: the customer should see it end, and the
 * data should not accumulate rows that are neither orders nor anything else.
 *
 * They are moved to Cancelled rather than deleted — a checkout that was attempted
 * is a fact worth keeping, and `Pending → Cancelled` is already a legal transition.
 *
 * No stock or money is touched here on purpose: an unpaid order never held either.
 * Reserved stock is released by the reservation sweeper above, keyed on its own
 * expiry, so the two never both act on the same units.
 *
 * The status filter makes it a claim, so a concurrent payment that completes at the
 * same moment wins and its order is never cancelled out from under it.
