     * How long an ABANDONED intent is retained. Cleared (`undefined`) the moment
     * the intent completes, so this only ever expires checkouts nobody paid for.
     *
     * This is a RECONCILIATION window, and it is deliberately much longer than
     * the 20-minute abandoned-order sweep — the two are not the same clock and
     * must not be equalised:
     *
     *   RESERVATION_TTL_MS       20 min   how long stock is held. Short because
     *                                     holding it starves other buyers.
     *   AWAITING_PAYMENT_TTL_MS  20 min   when the unpaid order row is closed
     *                                     out. Short so abandoned checkouts stop
     *                                     looking like live orders.
     *   this                     7 days   how long we can still IDENTIFY a late
     *                                     capture. Long on purpose: a Razorpay
     *                                     order stays payable after our order row
     *                                     has been swept, and deleting the intent
     *                                     destroys the only link from that
     *                                     payment back to a customer and a cart.
     *
     * Shortening this to match the sweep would make late captures *less*
     * recoverable, not more. The safety property does not come from the TTL at
     * all: a capture with no intent is recorded in `unmatchedpayments` and
     * auto-refunded, so there is no window in which money can be captured, be
     * unpromotable, and go uncompensated. The TTL only decides how much context
     * that compensation gets to record.
