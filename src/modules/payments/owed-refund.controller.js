/**
 * The queue of refunds the store has admitted it owes and has not yet paid.
 *
 * `status: "owed"` is an entry in the existing refund ledger, written by
 * recordRefundObligation when money is due but must not be moved automatically —
 * an RTO detected from a courier feed being the main case. That was the right
 * decision (an unattended feed must not push irreversible refunds) but it left the
 * liability with no reader anywhere: correctly recorded, and invisible.
 *
 * The LIST endpoint is read-only. Settlement lives beside it in
 * AdminSettleOwedRefundManually below, but only for obligations that a gateway
 * can never pay (COD and other offline money): the operator has already moved
 * the money by hand and records the reference that proves it. Anything Razorpay
 * can refund automatically is refused here and must go through the existing
 * gateway refund endpoint — this must not become a way to mark a payable
 * gateway refund "done" without the money moving.
 *
 * Sorted oldest-first, because the age of an unpaid liability is what makes it
 * urgent — a list ordered by anything else buries the worst case.
