/**

 * every branch, and a regression test asserts it stays that way.
 *
 * It is also not a generic courier adapter. There is exactly one operation here —
 * write down who carried the parcel and under what number — because that is the
 * whole of what manual shipping needs. Shiprocket's own flows are untouched.
