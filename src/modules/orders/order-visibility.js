/**
 * The single definition of "this order is real".
 *
 * Razorpay orders are created BEFORE the customer pays, at
 * `paymentStatus: "Pending"` / `orderStatus: "Pending"`, and are promoted to
 * `Paid` / `Confirmed` once the payment is verified. That gives an order number
 * up front and a durable record to reconcile a captured-but-unmatched payment
 * against — but it also means the `orders` collection now contains checkouts that
 * were started and abandoned.
 *
 * Those are not orders. They have no money behind them, the customer does not
 * think they bought anything, and no stock has been committed to them. Counting
 * one as revenue is the single most likely way this design goes wrong: before this
 * module existed, every revenue aggregate filtered on
 * `orderStatus: { $ne: "Cancelled" }` and nothing else, so an abandoned checkout
 * would have landed in `totalRevenue` and in the daily charts.
 *
 * Hence one exported filter, used everywhere, and a test
 * (`tests/orders.visibility.regression.mjs`) that fails if a new aggregate over
 * `orders` forgets it. A COD order at `Pending` is genuinely real — the customer
 * placed it and owes cash on delivery — so the filter is deliberately narrow: it
 * excludes only the prepaid-and-unpaid case.

 * It does NOT match the payment-intent TTL, and an earlier comment here wrongly
 * said it did. The intent is retained far longer on purpose — it is the
 * reconciliation record, and a Razorpay order remains payable after this sweep
 * has closed our order row. See `PAYMENT_INTENT_RETENTION_MS`.
 *
 * That gap is real and cannot be closed by tuning either number, because the
 * gateway decides when a payment can still be captured. It is made safe instead
 * by compensation: a capture that can no longer be promoted is recorded in

 * browser-verify path. See orphaned-capture.service.js.
