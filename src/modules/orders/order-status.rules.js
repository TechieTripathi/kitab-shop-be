/**
 * Legal order-status transitions.
 *
 * `UpdateOrderStatus` previously validated only that the target value existed
 * in the enum, never what the order's current status was — so all 81 ordered
 * pairs were permitted from the admin dropdown. That allowed, among others:
 *
 *   Cancelled → Confirmed   stock already restored and never re-deducted
 *                           (guaranteed oversell), wallet/coupon already
 *                           returned, refund already paid, order shippable
 *                           again → money out AND goods out.
 *   Cancelled → Delivered   COD flips to Paid, booking revenue for cash that
 *                           was never collected, and re-opens the return window.
 *   Shipped   → Pending     re-opens CUSTOMER self-cancellation on a parcel
 *                           already in transit → full refund + full restock
 *                           while the parcel still delivers.
 *
 * The returns module already had this pattern (return.controller.js); orders
 * never got it. Both the admin endpoint and the Shiprocket webhook validate
 * against this table so a replayed or out-of-order courier event cannot walk a
 * status backwards either.

  // that move (UpdateOrderStatus refuses Cancelled outright, the cancel
  // endpoints claim pre-dispatch statuses only, the webhook never maps to it),

  // dead option read as "cancellation is broken". An RTO ends through its own
  // close-out below.
  RTO: ["RTO Received"],
  // "Closed" is how an RTO ends: the parcel is back, its condition recorded, and
  // any refund owed settled. It used to close out as "Cancelled", which
  // overloaded that status with two quite different meanings — "the customer or
  // seller called this off before dispatch" and "we shipped it, it came back".
  // Reporting has to exclude both from revenue, but only one of them is a
  // cancellation.
  "RTO Received": ["Closed"],
  // "Completed" is the admin's explicit sign-off that a delivered order's case
  // is finished — customer kept it, nothing pending. It stays REVENUE (it is
  // deliberately absent from NON_REVENUE_STATUSES) and closes self-service
  // returns, which gate on status "Delivered". Delivered orders are otherwise
  // unwound through the Returns flow.
  Delivered: ["Completed"],
  // Terminal. Cancelled orders must never be resurrected — cancellation
  // carries compensation logic that a bare status edit does not perform.

  // Terminal. A closed RTO is finished: nothing further ships, nothing further
  // restocks, and it is not revenue.
  Closed: [],
