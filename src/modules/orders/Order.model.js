/**
 * Courier identity, enforced by the database.
 *
 * The Shiprocket webhook resolves an order by these fields, and they carried
 * plain NON-UNIQUE indexes — so the lookup could legitimately match several orders
 * and the driver returned an arbitrary one. A `Delivered` event applied to the
 * wrong order stamps `deliveredAt` and flips a COD order to `Paid`, booking
 * revenue for cash nobody collected.
 *
 * PARTIAL, not sparse, and that distinction is load-bearing here. `sparse` skips
 * only ABSENT fields, and both of these are declared `default: null` — so 54 of 55
 * existing orders store an explicit `null`, which indexes like any other value. A
 * `unique + sparse` index would either fail to build on those duplicate nulls or
 * make the second shipment-less order collide with E11000. Keying the partial
 * filter on `$type` indexes only rows carrying a real identifier, which is exactly
 * the set that must be unique. Same reasoning as `user_1_idempotencyKey_1` above.
 *
 * Verified before adding: 0 duplicate real values in the live collection, so no
 * data cleanup was required.
 *
 * `shiprocket.orderId` is 1:1 with an order by construction — createShiprocketOrder
 * posts `order_id: String(order._id)`. `shiprocket.awbCode` is a single scalar for
 * the order's one shipment; per-shipment AWBs would live in `shipments[].awbCode`,
 * which nothing writes today.
 *
 * EXPLICITLY NAMED, and that matters for deployment. The plain indexes these
 * replace already own the auto-generated names `shiprocket.orderId_1` /
 * `shiprocket.awbCode_1`, and MongoDB refuses to redefine an index under an
 * existing name — so an auto-named version fails with IndexKeySpecsConflict on
 * every boot (autoIndex and syncIndexes alike), silently leaving the collection
 * non-unique. Distinct names let these build immediately, with no migration
 * ordering to get wrong; `npm run migrate:shipment-indexes` then drops the old
 * plain indexes, which are redundant once these exist.
